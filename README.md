# DC-Motor-Speed-and-PWM-Control-using-PIC16F877A

- This project involves the design and implementation of a DC Motor Speed and PWM control. PIC16F877A has been used for this purpose. The programming for the PIC has been performed on Embedded C (implemented on MPLAB X).
- Separate functions on Embedded C have been designed to perform Pulse Width Modulation, Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC), generate delays etc, and the code designed works in harmony with the Proteus Simulations to give rise to the DC Motor. 
- The speed control works in a way that when the speed of the motor exceeds the maximum speed, the LED glows, thus indicating overflow. 
- The PWM can be visualized using the Digital Oscilloscope. As the speed of the DC Motor is increased, the duty cycle of the PWM increases.
- The change in speed of the DC Motor can be visualized through proteus and also through the digital oscilloscope available. 
- The DC Motor is also capable of rotating in both clockwise and ant-clockwise directions. The direction of rotation can be manipulated using a simple switch provided in the proteus schematic. 
- An LCD Interface has also been provided on the proteus schematic to monitor the current speed of the DC Motor. 
- DC Motor finds vast applications in domains like manufacturing industry, for designing machines like cranes, elevators etc, which involve bi-directional motion.
